    "This task of the assignment comprises of extracting the job related information for a job posting. The extracted data has to be written to a json and xml file of a similar structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task was achieved in the following steps:\n",
    "- Read the job posting file 29262909.dat.\n",
    "- Analysed the data to identify the patterns in the data.\n",
    "- Designed regex and other logics to extract most of the data effeciently.\n",
    "- Write extracted data to json and xml\n",
    "\n",
    "More details for each task will be given in the following sections."

    "This task measured the understanding of parsing dirty data of huge numbers using Python, not using external packages. The main outcomes were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading file** - Reading a single file of that many lines at a point had to made effecient as the buffer memory could not allocatte so much for reading the whole data at once.\n",
    "- **Designing Regex** - Scanned through the raw data file to find variations and patterns which could help form the regex to effeciently extract most chunks of data.\n",
    "- **Extracting data** - Processing the records and extracting them one by one using the regex designed.\n",
    "- **Processing 30K+ records** - Effectively processed the records in a very small amount of time approximately 1K records in a second.\n",
    "- **Writing structured output files** - Writing the extracted data to the JSON and XML structured format, using well defined tags and child separators."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This task measured the understanding of extracting meaningful information from a large number of files using Python and NLTK. The main outcomes acheived were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-processing the data** - The data should be cleaned before processing just to extract meaningful information much effectively.\n",
    "- **Generating Bigrams and MWETokenizer** - Generating bigrams based on the corpus and using multi word tokenizer to tokenise them.\n",
    "- **Filtering certain type of words** - Filter of certain type of words which are not useful for analysis such as stop words, common tokens, rare tokens and short tokens,\n",
    "- **Calculating term frequency and document frequency** - The calculation of term frequency and document frequency can be further used to provide recommendations.\n",
    "- **Stemming the words** - Rooting the word is important as the variations in the language can make two contextually similar words appear different although their essence is same"
